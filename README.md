### Difficulty level: intermediate.

## What You'll Learn

Many people struggle with figuring out where to start testing and what to test next.
In general you should start testing Outside In, as described in Josh Clayton's
"Test-Driven Rails" workshop.

This exercise helps walk you through building a Rails application using the
Outside In methodology. All the specs you need are pending and have no code, so
you get to write the test and make it pass in the correct order.

To teach what order you can test in, we've included a tag in each spec. This
will help you to implement tests using the Outside In methodologies in your
Rails apps.

The tags in the specs follow this structure: `Spec-1` `Spec-2` and so on until
the last spec.

## Working/Submitting

1. To work on this exercise, fork the repo.
2. Search for the first pending spec, e.g. `ag Spec-1` (if you have Silver
   Searcher installed) or `grep -nr Spec-2 spec`.
3. Continue making the tests pass in order until all tests have been implemented
   and are passing.
4. Create a pull request so your code can be reviewed.
5. Perform a code review on at least one other person's implementation. Your
   comments should follow our code review guidelines:
https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review. Most important: be
friendly. Make suggestions, not demands.
6. Improve your solution based on the comments you've received and approaches
   you've learned from reviewing others' attempts.
